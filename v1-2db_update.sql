On marketbeatingstocks.com...\nChaz Hinkle:  Am trying to set/reset some permissions on some of my files...\nChaz Hinkle:  but it is not letting me.\nJesse C:  Sorry to hear you are having trouble with this Chaz.\nChaz Hinkle:  not sure what the problem is or why.. I\'ve always been able to FTP in and set these.\nJesse C:  In order to change the permissions on files in FTP, you would need to log into our FTP servers with the username that owns the file.\nJesse C:  As our servers use standard Linux user and group permissions, there is no concept of a master account within FTP.\nJesse C:  What files are you trying to set the permissions on?\nChaz Hinkle:  Yeh, have tried logging in with FTP owner credentials... No dice... It\'s in a folder called /data the folder itself is chmod to 777 but the files within it are all 775, and that\'s the problem...\nChaz Hinkle:  I need them to all be 776 or 777\nJesse C:  I am reading that this folder does not have execute permissions on it.\nJesse C:  The data folder is currently set to rw-rw-rw\nChaz Hinkle:  well, the folder seems to have 777 permissions... but the individual folders appear to be 775... So when it tries to rewrite them, it pukes.\nJesse C:  Which FTP user are you logged into currently?\nChaz Hinkle:  stocktips\nChaz Hinkle:  it\'s the only one we have set up for the account.\nJesse C:  Try removing execute permissions on the data folder then adding these permissions back in\nChaz Hinkle:  Okay... I did that... And I set it to recurse into the files and subdirectories... It worked on /data, but on all the files it throws PERMISSION DENIED\nChaz Hinkle:  Rather...\nChaz Hinkle:  OPERATION NOT PERMITTED\nJesse C:  Try changing this just on the data folder first without recursing.\nJesse C:  This folder would need execute permissions before the files can be changed\nChaz Hinkle:  nope... still get OPERATION NOT PERMITTED\nJesse C:  Let me try changing the permissions on this from my side.\nChaz Hinkle:  k\nJesse C:  The data folder now has execute permissions on it and you can now access the folder from FTP, however the files within this folder do not belong to your user, so you are not able to chmod them\nJesse C:  As impersonation was not used on the site, these files have been uploaded as pcuser.\nJesse C:  I can change these files to your user, however in order to prevent this from occuring again, impersonation should be used on your site as per our Knowledge Base article.\nJesse C:  http://cloudsites.rackspacecloud.com/index.php/How_do_I_add_impersonation_for_ASPUpload\nChaz Hinkle:  You have a link... Ah, nevermind... Okay... first I have heard of this issue... I\'ll read it.\nJesse C:  Would you like me to change the permissions on these files to your user?\nChaz Hinkle:  Please\nJesse C:  All done\nChaz Hinkle:  That article looks to be pertaining to ASPUpload...\nChaz Hinkle:  I\'m not using ASPUpload for this... I am using the regular FileSystemObject\nChaz Hinkle:  Does the same thing still apply? Is there a knowledge base article on that as well?\nJesse C:  There is no Knowledge Base article for using FileSystemObject for ASP. Just the one for aspupload as well as the .NET impersonation article.\nChaz Hinkle:  hmmm. okay. I USED to be able to set permissions via the control panel... But looks like that is gone now?\nJesse C:  We did have a file manager to manage permissions, however we took down the file manager for security concerns and now changes must either be done on our side or through FTP.\nChaz Hinkle:  Okay. Cool. Thanks for your help Jesse.', '2010-07-24 19:35:48', '2010-07-24 19:35:48'),
